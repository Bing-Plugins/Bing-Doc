# Floodgate support

BingQueue can be installed on sub-servers (branches of Bukkit, such as: Spigot, Paper), which not only allows the customization of the UI pages for Java edition users, but also supports the UI pages for bedrock edition players through Geyser + Floodgate.

These language information are stored in the lang.yml file on the sub-server.

每个按钮也可以设置为相适应的链接图片，只需要将网站填入子服务器的 config.yml 文件中，并且按如下命名设置图片名称，就可以在 UI 页面中显示图片了。
