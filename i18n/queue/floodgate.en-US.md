# Floodgate support

BingQueue can be installed on sub-servers (branches of Bukkit, such as: Spigot, Paper), which not only allows the customization of the UI pages for Java edition users, but also supports the UI pages for bedrock edition players through Geyser + Floodgate.

This language information is stored in the subserver's `lang.yml` file.

Each button can also be set to the appropriate link image, just fill in the sub-server's `config.yml` file with the website and set the image name as named below to display the image in the UI page.
