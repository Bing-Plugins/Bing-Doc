BingQueue can be installed on sub-servers (branches of Bukkit, such as: Spigot, Paper), which not only allows the customization of the UI pages for Java edition users, but also supports the UI pages for bedrock edition players through Geyser + Floodgate.

Each button can also be set to the corresponding linked image, just fill in the website in the config.yml file on the sub-server, and set the image name as follows, you can display the image in the UI page.
