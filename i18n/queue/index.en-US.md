# Welcome to the BingQueue guide

Thank you for using BingQueue, this plugin is updated for a long time.

Mainly used in proxy-side (BungeeCord/Velocity) and its branches, to determine which server the player should connect to based on server status, online player count, server MOTD and other methods.

Usually used for matching systems, the plugin has been debugged and improved for a long time, and it is currently running stably.It runs best on Velocity, and the stability on BungeeCord and its branches has not been fully tested.
